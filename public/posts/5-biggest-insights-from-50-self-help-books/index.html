I still remember the first ever self help book I&rsquo;ve read - &ldquo;Borrowing Brilliance&rdquo; by David Kord Murray. The book was about how creative ideas are generated and how you can train yourself to be creative. That book had greatly helped me in learning the underlying process of thinking outside the box, but that was just the gist of it. What was perhaps the most valuable thing the book had given to me was the realization that books can alter your perspective about life itself. I was stunned to realize that reading a book is like entering a whole unique world, exploring new ideas and perspectives, and exiting as a changed, different person. From that point on, I was super interested in reading self help books and I&rsquo;ve devoted myself into reading more. Until today, I&rsquo;ve read over 50 self help books, and needless to say that I benefitted from each and every one of them. Today, I would like to share with you 5 of the biggest insights I&rsquo;ve got from the 50 books I&rsquo;ve read. These 5 insights are lifechanging to me, and they had greatly influenced how I viewed the world of today. Without further ado, here we go!</p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507413245164-6160d8298b31?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzNjAwOTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2OHx8YnJhaW58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTczMzc0MTQ0NHww&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="A ball of energy with electricity beaming all over the place."></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Your mind is the source of your power. You are shaped by your mind. You make decisions and take actions based on your thoughts. Hence, train your mind, cultivate your thoughts, so that you can control it and harness it&#39;s greatest power.
</code></pre><p>What is the difference between the mediocre and the powerful? Both are built the same, both are humans and both are vulnerable to the same magnitude of emotions and pleasures. Why can some people, in the face of struggles, still grow and emerge victory? The answer is: they&rsquo;ve managed to control their thoughts to be resistant and persistent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you care for your mind, if you nurture it and if you cultivate it just like a fertile, rich garden, it will blossom far beyond your expectations. But if you let the weeds take root, lasting peace of mind and deep inner harmony will always elude you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robin Sharma, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the book, he mentioned how your thoughts can influence your emotions and actions. Try to recall the times where you felt unhappy or down. Are they all caused by a negative thought in your mind? See? Our mind influences our happiness. If we can control our mind, we can control when we want to feel happy or sad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tiredness was nothing more than a mental creation, a bad habit your mind has cultivated to act as a crutch when you are performing a tedious task.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robin Sharma, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like happiness, our feeling of tiredness is also caused by a thought. The thought of performing a challenging task will make us feel tired. If we can control our thoughts, we can identify these thoughts and deal with them strategically, so that we won&rsquo;t succumb to the inevitable feeling of tiredness. So the question is, is it possible for us to control what we think? Or is it completely determined by external events? The answer is: oh hell yea it is within our control, we just have to train ourselves to control it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</li>
</ul>

<p>Viktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist, psychologist, and philosopher, experienced many hardships in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Frankl endured physical abuse, malnutrition, and torture, experienced emotional humiliation and loss of hope, dignity, and meaning. Moreover, Frankl and other prisoners became apathetic after becoming accustomed to camp life. However, after the concentration camp, he not only survived, but he thrived. He converted what was perhaps to most traumatic experience for others, to what was perhaps the most valuable phase of life to him. His experience in the concentration camp compelled him to write the best-selling book: &ldquo;The Man&rsquo;s Search for meaning&rdquo;. In that book, he shows how a thought can make people survive even in the harshest of situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who have a &lsquo;why&rsquo; to live, can bear with almost any &lsquo;how&rsquo;.
Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.</p>

<h1 id="2-you-have-to-feel-sad">2. You Have To Feel Sad</h1>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521075486433-bf4052bb37bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzNjAwOTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxM3x8c2FkfGVufDB8MHx8fDE3MzM5Nzg5OTN8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="I received a call from the school nurse, who put my son on the line. My son told me he was very sad and was feeling depressed. I immediately went to my son’s school to pick him up. Before we left, we met with one of the administrators, who helped my son feel a little better. The whole afternoon I couldn’t stop thinking about how sad my son was when I arrived at the school. A few hours later, when I went upstairs for some quiet time, it hit me that my son may be depressed…just like me.What I love about this image is the raw emotion that shows just how hard parenting can be sometimes."></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Most of us think that our prime goal in this world is to maximize our happiness and minimize our sadness. And boy how wrong are we! Science, philosophy, and history have repeatedly showed us that sadness is a mandatory emotion in our lives. It is what causes us to grow and thrive. The goal is not to eliminate sadness, but to embrace it. If you experienced a week where you don&#39;t feel sad at all, then something is wrong somewhere in you.
</code></pre><p>If you think about it, you will find that it makes perfect sense. Sadness, just like happiness, is a basic emotion of humans. So, why should we try to suppress sadness and only focus on happiness? It is not normal at all!</p>
<p>One of the reasons why people nowadays tried to avoid feeling sad is due to the emergence of social media and the internet. The internet is filled with people experiencing unhealthy amount of pleasures and positivity. This causes us to have a biased thought that we should feel more happy. However, one shall remind themselves that this is false in so many levels. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong for you to feel sad, it is mandatory for you to feel sad. Let me repeat this: <strong>If you experienced a week where you don&rsquo;t feel sad at all, then something is wrong somewhere in you.</strong></p>
<p>This invaluable insight from the book &ldquo;The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A FxxK&rdquo; by Mark Manson had induced me to take up a rather counterintuitive habit. You may have heard of the habit of making a gratefulness list, but have you heard of a suffering list? That&rsquo;s right. By having a suffering list (alongside with a gratefulness list), you can ensure that you are feeling a balanced amount of happiness and sadness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone suffers form their lives. The rich suffers because their rich, the poor suffers from poverty; A family guy suffers because he has a family; an alone guy suffers because he has no family. There won’t be a life without suffering. The simplest reason to this is because suffering is beneficial to us. Suffering is what makes us evolve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark Manson, the subtle art of not giving a fxxk</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We humans are social creatures, and we will tend to mimic those around us. Now that we are living in a society that values being happy so much, we have to constantly remind ourselves that we have to feel sad. This is the only way for us to stay emotionally healthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There won’t be a life without problems. We don’t just solve a problem, we simply converted it to another form of problem, and we had to solve that problem too. But that’s okay, because happiness comes from solving problems, not from having no problems. So, you must choose what you’re willing to struggle for, what problems you’re willing to solve.</p>
<ul>

<h1 id="3-move-with-a-sense-of-purpose">3. Move With A Sense Of Purpose</h1>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1470506926202-05d3fca84c9a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzNjAwOTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxNHx8bWFwfGVufDB8MHx8fDE3MzQzMjM3NDR8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="Treasure hunt map"></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>A life without purpose is a life wasted. Purpose can help us define who we are and let us tackle life with a strong sense of objectivity. Having a purpose doesn&#39;t just affect your life; it affects the people around you as well. Treat life as if you are a warior, navigating through it using your map of purpose, and ultimately achieve eternal fulfilment.
</code></pre><p>The hardest part is actually finding the purpose that is good enough for you. You have to aim very high while still retaining the feeling that the purpose is achievable, otherwise it will just become a dream (aimed too high) or a goal (aimed too low).</p>
<p>A purpose is an ideal state of yourself. Imagine, what does your best self look like? What kind of person do you want to be? A curious person? A productive person? A loving person? That is your purpose, and we must orient our lives towards those pursuits. Set mini goals for yourself so that you can move closer and closer towards your ideal self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goals make up the story that we want to be told about ourselves</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark Congdon, The Ideal Life</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose is also the why in your life. By discovering your why, you are able to escape the mediocre and become the magnet of attraction to others. But at that point, if you have really found your purpose, what others think of you shall not be of importance to you anymore. All of your energy will be channeled towards orienting yourself to your purpose, while the opinions of others will fade away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your eyes must be on the larger trends that govern events, on that which is not immediately visible. Never lose sight of your long-term goals. With an elevated perspective, you will have the patience and clarity to reach almost any objective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert Greene, The Laws Of Human Nature</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="purpose-is-an-antidote-towards-manipulation">Purpose Is An Antidote Towards Manipulation</h3>
<p>This curious insight is found in the book &ldquo;Start With Why&rdquo; by Simon Sinek. It talks about how most companies nowadays operate using manipulation, and how we as entrepreneurs can bypass this trap by communicating our &ldquo;why&rdquo; to our customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most dangerous part about manipulation is that it works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simon Sinek, Start With Why</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to extend this insight towards our personal lives as well.</p>
<p>In life, it is inevitable for us to face manipulation, and we thought that we have to use manipulation as well in order to get what we want. As proof, there are many books out there trying to teach us about manipulation: &ldquo;48 Laws Of Power&rdquo;, &ldquo;Art Of Seduction&rdquo;, &ldquo;How To Win Friends And Influence People&rdquo; just to name a few, and those book got great sales. This shows just how eager it is for people to want to master manipulation and apply it to get what they want. I would like to argue that we can do better.</p>
<p>Instead of using cheap tactics to attract others, we just have to move with a sense of purpose. Our purpose can make us radiant. Those who resonates with our purpose will naturally come to us, and they will stick with us and be loyal to us, no manipulations needed.</p>
